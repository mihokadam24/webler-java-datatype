# Primitive data types and Wrapper Classes

## Primitive data types

- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- boolean
- char

## Wrapper Classes

- Byte
- Short
- Integer
- Long
- Float
- Double
- Boolean
- Character

## Autoboxing and Unboxing

- Autoboxing is the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between the primitive types and their corresponding
- object wrapper classes. For example, converting an int to an Integer, a double to a Double, and so on. If the conversion
- goes the other way, this is called unboxing.
- The following table lists the primitive types and their corresponding wrapper classes, which are used by the Java compiler
- for autoboxing and unboxing:

| Primitive Type | Wrapper Class |
| -------------- | ------------- |
| boolean        | Boolean       |
| char           | Character     |
| byte           | Byte          |
| short          | Short         |
| int            | Integer       |
| long           | Long          |
| float          | Float         |
| double         | Double        |
